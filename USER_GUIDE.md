## üí° Tips for Best Experience

### For Live Environment (your computer):
1. Ensure webcam and microphone permissions are granted
2. Install espeak for voice output: `sudo apt install espeak`
3. Install pyaudio for microphone: `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev`
4. Use in a quiet environment for better speech recognition

### Privacy & Security:
- All conversations are stored locally in `data/persona_memory.db`
- No data is sent to external servers except for speech recognition
- WhatsApp integration uses browser automation (secure)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Camera not available"**
- Ensure webcam is connected and not used by other apps
- Grant camera permissions to Python/terminal

**"Microphone not available"**
- Install pyaudio: `pip install pyaudio`
- Grant microphone permissions
- Check if microphone is working with other apps

**"TTS engine failed"**
- Install espeak: `sudo apt install espeak espeak-data`
- Or use text-only mode (assistant still works)

**"GUI not available"**
- Install tkinter: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
- Or use CLI mode instead

### Still Works Without:
Even if camera/microphone/voice aren't available, you can still:
- Use text commands (`say <message>`)
- Get work assistance
- Manage files
- Set reminders
- Use WhatsApp integration
